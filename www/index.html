<h1>Ralph's software defined radio</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<a href="sdr-images.html"><img class="flow" src="sdr-s.png"/></a>
<p>
This is the design for a software defined radio receiver.  It consists of a
<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas Instruments</b></a> high-speed analog-to-digital converter, coupled with an FPGA
for DSP, and audio, USB, and parallel outputs.
</p>
<p>
While it's intended for SDR usage, although nothing stops it from being used as
an oscilloscope uploading data to a PC for display (although USB 2.0 can't cope
with anything like the full data rate off the ADC).
</p>
<p>
The main board takes RF input via a 50&ohm; SMA connector feeding the A-to-D, which then passes the digitised signal to the FPGA at up to
3.5Gbps.  The FPGA (when correctly programmed) processes the data and passes it
on to the outputs.

Here's an ethernet eye diagram captured using the board.
I've put a few <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/112479675359081860179/albums/5666987908797332145">radio spectra</a> on google+ too.

<h2>Main components</h2>
<p>
The main silicon are a <a href="http://www.ti.com/">Texas
Instruments</a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/ads41b49.html">ADS41B49</a>
analog-to-digital converter and a
Xilinx <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/spartan6/">Spartan 6</a> LX9
FPGA.
</p>
<p>
Outputs are audio (what good is a radio if you can't listen to it!), USB and
quite a few digital lines via 0.1 inch headers.
</p>
<p>
The audio output is a <a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/pcm1771.html">PCM1771</a>.
</p>
<p>
USB is via a
FTDI <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT2232H.htm">FT2232H</a>
chip; this has two channels.  Channel A is connected to FPGA IO, and channel B
is dedicated to the FPGA JTAG.
</p>
<p>
There's an ARM Cortex M3 CPU on the board, a
<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/lm3s828.html">LM3S828</a>.
It doesn't go anywhere near the data processing chain, it's there for
supervisory functions; it's got a 5-way switch hanging off it and a fast serial
link to the FPGA.  Also, it's the same package as the ADC, so it gives me useful
soldering practice.
</p>
<p>
Misc. ICs are three power converters, an EEPROM, serial flash, a level converter
and two oscillators (one left unpopulated).
</p>
<p>
The FPGA is a baby one, but even though, it should provide enough resources
to provide seven or eight separate receiver channels.
</p>
<h2>Input sensitivity</h2>
<p>
The A-to-D takes a 1V to 1.5V p-p differential input signal (depending on
internal config), but the input has a 1:2.8 (1:8 impedance ratio) step up
transformer
(<a href="http://www.coilcraft.com/"><b>Coilcraft</b></a> <a href="http://www.coilcraft.com/wbc.cfm">WBC8-1L</a>),
giving a 360mV p-p input range.  The A-to-D is 14-bit, which gives
approx. 21&micro;V resolution, which is -78dBm into 50&ohm; (although
realistically you probably want a -60dBm signal).
</p>
<p>
The low end of the input frequency response is limited by the input transformer;
it goes down to about 500kHz.  The A-to-D is rated for input signals up to about
800MHz, but I suspect the PCB layout of the input circuits will be a limitation
also.
</p>
<h2>Power supplies</h2>
<p>
The board uses three voltage levels: 3.3V, 1.8V and 1.2V, all supplied via
switchmode converters.  A
<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/pth08080w.html">PTH08080W</a>
module supplies 3.3V, a <a href="http://www.national.com/analog/"><b>National
Semiconductor</b></a> <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMZ12002.html">LMZ12002</a>
module supplies 1.2V, and a National
Semiconductor <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM3671.html">LM3671</a>
provides 1.8V.  The last of these hangs off the 3.3V rail, the first two can
cope with a reasonable voltage range, so either a 5V or 12V input is fine.
</p>
<p>
The 3.3V and 1.2V power supplies are over provisioned, both can provide about 2
amps, but much less than that is needed in practice.  The total power
consumption should be about 2.5W, meaning that it'll run off USB on a good day
(there's an alternative power jack as well).
</p>
<h2>Design software</h2>
<p>
The board design is done using the free
software <a href="http://www.gpleda.org/index.html">gEDA</a> toolchain, written
by <b>Ales Hvezda and hundreds of others</b>.  The files sdr-*.sch are the main
board schematic, and sdr.pcb is the pcb layout for it, a four layer board with
6mil minimum trace width and separation.
</p>
<p>
Xilinx ISE is used for compiling the VHDL code to run on the FPGA.
</p>
<h2>Daughter boards</h2>
<a href="input.html"><img class="flow" src="input-4509-third.png" /></a>
<p>
A <a href="input.html">daughter board</a> (files input-4509-third.sch and
input-4509-third.pcb) provides an RF amp (<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/ths4509.html">THS4509</a>)
and a third-order band pass filter.  The first build of that will provide 20db
gain on the 88MHz to 108Mhz band with a 300&ohm; input.  That's stereo FM off a
folded dipole aerial.  Although where I live, the signal strength is probably
high enough to go into the ADC unamplified.
</p>
<p>
I'm skimping on the pcb for this board; it's a two layer board, but with
appropriate values for the filter components, it should do for front ends up to
a few hundred MHz or so.
</p>
<h3>Ethernet Tap</h3>
<a href="ether-spy-rv.png"><img class="lflow" src="ether-spy-rv-s.png" /></a>
<a href="ether-spy-rvb.png"><img class="flow" src="ether-spy-rvb-s.png" /></a>
<p>
Also, I'm building a input board that gives me a 50&ohm; tap off an ethernet
cable.  This board has a fun construction; the three 133&ohm; load resistors are
0603 components mounted vertically within holes in the PCB, connecting traces on
opposite sides of the board.
</p>
<p>
This board is entirely passive.  The tap is off pair 2 (pins 3 and 6), a star
topology splits current coming in one jack equally between the other jack and
the tap transformer.  The tap transformer is 2:1 impedance ratio, so the 50&ohm;
SMA connection on the secondary appears as a 100&ohm; load on the primary.
</p>
<p>
The other three pairs have a resistor network to match the 6db insertion loss
from the tap.  Oh, I forgot the 33&ohm; of additional matching load resistance
on the tap, so I'll have to break a trace to solder that resistor.  Serves me
right for laying out a board without a proper circuit diagram.
