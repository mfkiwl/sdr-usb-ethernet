<h1>Ralph's software defined radio</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is the design for a software defined radio.  It consists of a high-speed
analog-to-digital converter, coupled with an FPGA for DSP, and audio, USB, and
parallel outputs.
</p>
<p>
While it's intended for SDR usage, although nothing stops it from being used as
an oscilloscope uploading data to a PC for display (although USB 2.0 can't cope
with anything like the full data rate of the ADC).
</p>
<p>
The main board takes RF input via a 50&ohm; SMA connector feeding the A-to-D,
which then passes the digitised signal to the FPGA at up to 3.5Gbps.  The FPGA
(when correctly programmed) processes the data and passes it on to the outputs.

<h2>Main components</h2>
<p>
The main silicon are a Texas

analog-to-digital converter and a
Xilinx <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/spartan6/">Spartan 6</a> LX9
FPGA.
</p>
<p>
Outputs are audio (what good is a radio if you can't listen to it!), USB and
quite a few digital lines via 0.1 inch headers.
</p>
<p>
USB is via a
FTDI <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT2232H.htm">FT2232H</a>
chip; this has two channels.  Channel A is connected to FPGA IO, and channel B
is dedicated to the FPGA JTAG.
</p>
<p>
The audio output is a <a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/pcm1771.html">PCM1771</a>.
</p>
<p>
There's an ARM Cortex M3 CPU on the board, a
<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/lm3s828.html">LM3S828</a>.
It doesn't go anywhere near the data processing chain, it's there for
supervisory functions; it's got a 5-way switch hanging off it and a fast serial
link to the FPGA.  Also, it's the same package as the ADC, so it gives me useful
soldering practice.
</p>
<p>
Misc. ICs are three power converters, an EEPROM, serial flash, a level converter
and two oscillators (one left unpopulated).
</p>
<h2>Input sensitivity</h2>
<p>
The A-to-D takes a 1V to 1.5V p-p differential input signal (depending on
internal config), but the input has a 1:2.8 (1:8 impedence ratio) step up
transformer
(<a href="http://www.coilcraft.com/"><b>Coilcraft</b></a> <a href="http://www.coilcraft.com/wbc.cfm">WBC8-1L</a>),
giving a 360mV p-p input range.  The A-to-D is 14-bit, which gives
approx. 21&micro;V resolution, which is -78dBm into 50&ohm; (although
realistically you probably want a -60dBm signal).
</p>
<h2>Power supplies</h2>
<p>
The board uses three voltage levels: 3.3V, 1.8V and 1.2V, all supplied via
switchmode converters.  A
<a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/pth08080w.html">PTH08080W</a>
module supplies 3.3V, a <a href="http://www.national.com/analog/"><b>National
Semiconductor</b></a> <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMZ12002.html">LMZ12002</a>
module supplies 1.2V, and a National
Semiconductor <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM3671.html">LM3671</a>
provides 1.8V.  The last of these hangs of the 3.3V rail, the first two can cope
with a reasonable voltage range, so either a 5V or 12V input is fine.
</p>
<p>
The 3.3V and 1.2V power supplies are over provisioned, both can provide about 2
amps, but much less than that is needed in practice.  The total power
consumption should be about 2.5W, meaning that it'll run off USB on a good day
(there's an alternative power jack as well).
</p>
<h2>Design software</h2>
<p>
The board design is done using the free
software <a href="http://www.gpleda.org/index.html">gEDA</a> toolchain, written
by <b>Ales Hvezda and hundreds of others</b>.  The files sdr-*.sch are the main
board schematic, and sdr.pcb is the pcb layout for it, a four layer board with
6mil minimum trace width and separation.
</p>
<p>
Xilinx ISE is used for compiling the VHDL code to run on the FPGA.
</p>
<h2>Daughter boards</h2>
<p>
A daughter board (files input-4509-third.sch and input-4509-third.pcb) provides
an RF amp
(TI <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/ths4509.html">THS4509</a>)
and a third-order band pass filter.  The first build of that will provide 20db
gain on the 88MHz to 108Mhz band with a 300&ohm; input.  That's stereo FM off a
folder dipole aerial.  Although where I live, the signal strength is probably
high enough to go into the ADC unamplified.
</p>
<p>
I'm skimping on the pcb for this board; it's a two layer board, but with
appropriate values for the filter components, it should do for front ends up to
a few hundred MHz or so.
</p>
<p>
Also, I'm building a input board that gives me a 50&ohm; tap off an ethernet
cable.

My LVDS link impedance are slightly low (86&ohm; instead of 100&ohm;), but the
traces are pretty short so it shouldn't matter.
