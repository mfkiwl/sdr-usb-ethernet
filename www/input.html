<p>This is an input board for my <a href="index.html">software defined
radio</a>.
</p>
<p>
A 300&ohm; input is amplified by a <a href="http://www.ti.com/"><b>Texas
Instruments</b></a> <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/ths4509.html">THS4509</a>
op. amp and passed through a third-order band pass filter, and output to a
50&ohm; SMA connector.
</p>
<p>
The initial build will be tuned to the broadcast audio FM band, with a 20db
gain, but all going well I'll build variants for different bands.
</p>
<p>
There's a couple of compromises in the design.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, I'm doing it on a two layer board, which makes proper impedance
matching of the traces impossible.  The trace impendance is too high, which
means that everything will see a few nH of parasitic inductance.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the band-pass filter is after the amplifier.  This makes the filter
component values more convenient and less sensitive to interferance, but means
that the op. amp is potentially swamped by a strong out-of-band signal.  This is
somewhat ameliorated both by the antennae response, and by the input coupling
capacitors giving a high pass filter.
