<h1>Ralph's software defined radio</h1>
<p>
The main board takes RF into a 50ohm SMA connector and various outputs.
</p>
<p>
The main silicon are a Texas Instruments ADS41B49 analog-to-digital converter
and with a Spartan6 LX9 FPGA.
</p>
<p>
Outputs are audio (what good is a radio if you can't listen to it!), USB and
quite a few digital lines via 0.1 inch heads.
</p>
<p>
USB is via a FTDI 2232H chip; this has two channels, channel A is connected
to FPGA IO, channel B is dedicated to the FPGA JTAG.
</p>
<p>
The audio output is a Texas Instruments PCM1771.
</p>
<p>
There's a ARM Cortex M3 on the board, it doesn't go anywhere near the data
processing chain, it's main purpose is for soldering practice (it's the same
footprint as the A-to-D.
</p>
<p>
The board design is done using the free gEDA toolchain.  The files sdr-*.sch are
the main board schematic, and sdr.pcb is the pcb layout for it, a four layer
board with 6mil minimum trace width and separation.
