RF boards.

Voltage monitors to CPU.

Add a 5v linear reg for display driver?

Check pinout of CPU jtag.
Sort out headers for CPU jtag and serial.

Header for FPGA jtag - improve pinout?

On right angle header, check pin size - 1mm hole looks huge...

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.

Dangle LED(s) off the CPU.

Input buttons.

Sort out main input capacitors.
+ output capacitors for PTH08080W.
+ double bypass on lm3671 input?
+ headers in main power feeds?


Does the double filtering on the DAC 1.8v digital make sense?
+ maybe separate filtering instead?


Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.

Provision CPU oscillator?

Activity LEDs on FT2232?

xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

If using 8p8c, then check the footprint.

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart.
Validate solder s0805 footprint.

Use capacitor arrays?

"Suspend must be low at power-up"

Spread out discretes nearw LMZ converter?

FPGA to ADC clock goes over a ground break.
OVR does not go over a ground.
Neaten up USB trace.
Redo ends of diff. pairs.
