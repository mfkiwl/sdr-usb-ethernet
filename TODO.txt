RF boards.

Voltage monitors to CPU?

On right angle header, check pin size - 1mm hole looks huge...
ok, but could reduce.

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.

Dangle LED(s) off the CPU?

Sort out main input capacitors.
+ double bypass on lm3671 input?


Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.


xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

Pad [rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2 Thickness Clearance Mask "name" "number" flags]
Element [SFlags "Desc" "Name" "Value" MX MY TX TY TDir TScale TSFlags]


Pin[rX rY Thickness Clearance Mask Drill "Name" "Number" SFlags]

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart.
+ Use capacitor array on clock if need be.
Validate solder s0805 footprint.


Check again all FPGA control pins.

OVR does not go over a ground.
Get termination resistors in some of the fpga lines to off board?
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Clean up CPU ground connections.
Check soic8, tssop16 and msop8 footprints.
Check that oscillator does not have extra pins.

Triaged....
Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, don't do it?
Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?
