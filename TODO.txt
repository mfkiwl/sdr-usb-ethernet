RF boards.

Voltage monitors to CPU.

Check pinout of CPU jtag.

Header for FPGA jtag - improve pinout?
Power / ground to both sides...

On right angle header, check pin size - 1mm hole looks huge...

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.

Dangle LED(s) off the CPU.

Input buttons.

Sort out main input capacitors.
+ output capacitors for PTH08080W?
+ double bypass on lm3671 input?


Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.

Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, could take a trace from fpga?

Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?

xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

* 20 pin headers *

Pad [rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2 Thickness Clearance Mask "name" "number" flags]
Element [SFlags "Desc" "Name" "Value" MX MY TX TY TDir TScale TSFlags]


Pin[rX rY Thickness Clearance Mask Drill "Name" "Number" SFlags]

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart.
+ Use capacitor array on clock if need be.
Validate solder s0805 footprint.


"Suspend must be low at power-up" - yeah lets triple check all FPGA control
pins.

Spread out discretes near LMZ converter?

FPGA to ADC clock goes over a ground break.
OVR does not go over a ground.
Neaten up USB trace.
Redo ends of diff. pairs.
Check FPGA voltages.
Protection diodes for RF input?
Check jumper pin sizes.
FPGA pins to bottom header.
Check tactile switch ground, or route it?
Get termination resistors in some of the fpga lines to off board.
Check that all FBs have enough capacitance downstream (oscillator!).
Choose decoupling caps for clock.
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Clean up CPU ground connections.
