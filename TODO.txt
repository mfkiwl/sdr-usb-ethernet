Check again all FPGA control pins.
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Check soic8, tssop16 and msop8 footprints.
Check that oscillator does not have extra pins.
Clean-up ground planes around lm3671.

LQFP144 pads are 23 mm ext to ext, compared with 22mm device.
LQFP64 pads are 12.8mm compared with 12mm device - widen by 0.1mm each side?

QFN48 exposed pad is 5.6mm by 5.6mm
pads are 8mm ext to ext (device is 7mm by 7mm).

SOIC8 is 7.35mm (291mil) ext to ext - CHECK THIS - looks OK to me.

SSOP16 is 292mil ext to ext (7.4mm) - package 6.4.
MSOP8 is 5.2mm ext to ext (205mil) - package 4.9 WIDEN

SOT23 is 105mil ext to ext (2.65mm) - might be narrow, but OK for this package?

Lengthen can cap pads.  Leads end-end is 7.4mm, currently have 7.7mm on pads,
added .35mm each end to give 8.4mm.

Pads for power input diode are too large.

Check USB pinout.

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart - needs reflow.

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.
Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.


xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, don't do it?
Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?
Voltage monitors to CPU?
