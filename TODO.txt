Check again all FPGA control pins.
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Check soic8, tssop16 and msop8 footprints.
Check that oscillator does not have extra pins.
Clean-up ground planes around lm3671.

More vias under cpu have cut up ground plane.

LQFP64 pads are 12.8mm compared with 12mm device - widen by 0.1mm each side?


Pads for power input diode are too large.

Check USB pinout.

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.

Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.
Inductor looks fine... LLP footprint?

xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

Triaged....
Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, don't do it?
Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?
Voltage monitors to CPU?


Verified....
LQFP144 pads are 23 mm ext to ext, compared with 22mm device.

SSOP16 is 292mil ext to ext (7.4mm) - package 6.4.

QFN48 exposed pad is 5.6mm by 5.6mm, pads are 8mm ext to ext (device is 7mm by 7mm).

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart - needs reflow, we can do it.

SOIC8 is 7.35mm (291mil) ext to ext - CHECK THIS - looks OK to me.


Done...

Lengthen can cap pads.  Leads end-end is 7.4mm, currently have 7.7mm on pads,
added .35mm each end to give 8.4mm.

Widen pads for push switch. 8mm end-end device, so we want 9mm.
We now have 1.4 by 1.6 pads instead of 1.2 by 1.4.

SC70 is 105mil ext to ext (2.65mm) - might be narrow, WIDEN
Device is 2.1, want 3.1

MSOP8 is 5.2mm ext to ext (205mil) - package 4.9 WIDEN
Want 5.9mm
