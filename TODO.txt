RF boards.

Voltage monitors to CPU.

Header for FPGA jtag - improve pinout?
Power / ground to both sides...

On right angle header, check pin size - 1mm hole looks huge...

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.
Impedance between SMA and trannie.

Dangle LED(s) off the CPU.

Input buttons.

Sort out main input capacitors.
+ output capacitors for PTH08080W?
+ double bypass on lm3671 input?


Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.

Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, don't do it?

Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?

xtal - footprint v. symbol.
+ pads are oversized internally...

Pad [rX1 rY1 rX2 rY2 Thickness Clearance Mask "name" "number" flags]
Element [SFlags "Desc" "Name" "Value" MX MY TX TY TDir TScale TSFlags]


Pin[rX rY Thickness Clearance Mask Drill "Name" "Number" SFlags]

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart.
+ Use capacitor array on clock if need be.
Validate solder s0805 footprint.


Cheap again all FPGA control pins.

OVR does not go over a ground.
Check FPGA voltages.
Protection diodes for RF input?
Get termination resistors in some of the fpga lines to off board.
Check that all FBs have enough capacitance downstream (oscillator!).
Choose decoupling caps for clock.
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Clean up CPU ground connections.
Clean up ground connections around usb xtal.


pth08080w pin size 40mil
headers fit just fine in 1mm, could go smaller.

Case connection on xtal.
