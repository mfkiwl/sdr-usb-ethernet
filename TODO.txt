Check again all FPGA control pins.
Solder points for a shield over the trannie.
Check soic8, tssop16 and msop8 footprints.
Check that oscillator does not have extra pins.
Clean-up ground planes around lm3671.

Check USB pinout.

Validate solder 0603 side by side 50 mils apart.
+ Use capacitor array on clock lines if need be.
Validate solder s0805 footprint.

Check SMA footprint against physical device.  Ditto other connectors etc.
Verify soldering LLP LM3671 + inductor.


xtal - footprint v. symbol.

Provision CPU oscillator? - low priority, don't do it?
Activity LEDs on FT2232? - only on port b, not worth it?  Worth doing anything
with spare port b pins?
Voltage monitors to CPU?
